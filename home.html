<h5>COACHING TECHNIQUE</h5>
<p>I've honoed my coacing techinique over the decades. i aim to communicate openly
    and clearly, addressing critical points and providing continuous, constructive 
    feedback.
</p>
<h5>GOALS</h5>
<p>The process starts with clearly defined objectives. How will you 
    know how to change if you don't know what needs changing. we'll develop
     your goals in conversation together.
</p>
<h5GROWTH</h5>
<p>The growth stage is teh meat in teh sandwich. It is here that you put new strategies to 
    work, and begin addressing the issues that have been holding you back.
</p>
<h5>REFLECTION</h5>
<p>
    At this point in the process i ask you to reflect on the changes you've made, and whether
    you're satisfied with there the results have led you. After this, we can 
    address sustainability.
</p>

    confidence, started taking more chances, and am even working towards 
    getting into college"</p> 
    <h5>-Neil Grimston</h5>
    <b>Philosophy</b>
         <p> I believe we all have the power to change our lives
             within us. I also believe there is no shame in asking for help to 
             deliver such change.
